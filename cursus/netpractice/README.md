# NetPractice

## Description
This project consists of a general practical exercise designed to introduce the basics of computer networking. The goal is to configure IP addresses, connect devices through routers, and understand the role of gateways within a network.

The exercises are performed on a training interface that simulates small-scale networks, where it is necessary to troubleshoot configuration problems to make the network function properly.

## Instructions

### Installation and Execution
This project does not require compilation. To run the training interface:

1. Download the files attached to the project page.
2. Extract the files into a local folder.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

**Submission details: The 10 exported configuration files (one per level) are placed at the root of the repository.**

## Resources
